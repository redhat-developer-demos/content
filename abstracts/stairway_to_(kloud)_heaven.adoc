= Stairway to (Kloud) Heaven
====

Do you get tired when they tell you to learn 12 factors, 8 steps to something, and more 10 tips to anything? We know the feeling: we don't promise it will be easy, but we promise that you'll be awesome!

Join us walking this stairway to heaven: and these days the Klouds start with K(ubernetes). 
When even your favorite GitHub repos are running on top of Kubernetes, you know you need to master it. 
On this hand-on workshop we'll nurture your applications from the source code, to build, to test, to debug, 
to deploy, to scaling, to resilience, to monitoring, and to heaven, with you and OpenShift. Don't miss it!
