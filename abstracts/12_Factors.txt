Challenged by the highly automated, virtualized and scalable infrastructure that Cloud enables? We now have a whole new set of restrictions and capabilities that demands we shift the way we architect our applications. Luckily enough, we already have a set of best practices given to us by brave cloud pioneers. Some of these best practices are collated as the “12 Factor Apps” (12factor.net). And how can you apply these practices in this new containerized world?

Dive with us into the 12-factor methodology and check how each one of the factors can be applied and even empowered by Linux container technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes. We don’t judge, so we’ll demo everything in a language and platform-agnostic way. Regardless of your choices, you’ll never think about your application architecture the same way again.
